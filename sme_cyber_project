# Draft Content: Compliance Tracker Modules

### Module 1: CERT-In Incident Reporting

*   **The Rule:** The CERT-In guidelines state that specific types of cyber incidents must be reported to the government within 6 hours of being noticed.
*   **Why it Matters:** Reporting on time is a legal requirement. Failure to do so can result in significant fines and legal action. It also helps the government track threats and protect other businesses.
*   **Your Action:** If you experience an incident (like ransomware or a data leak), you must use the official CERT-In portal to submit a report. Our tool can help you identify if an event is reportable.

### Module 2: The IT Act, 2000 (Section 43A)

*   **The Rule:** If your business possesses or handles any sensitive personal data, you must implement and maintain reasonable security practices to protect it.
*   **Why it Matters:** This rule makes you responsible for protecting your customers' data. If you are negligent and a breach occurs, you are liable to pay damages to the people affected.
*   **Your Action:** Our platform helps you implement "reasonable security" by scanning for vulnerabilities, providing employee training, and ensuring data is backed up.

# Marketing Copy: Don't Let One Click Bankrupt Your Business

*   **Covers the Real Costs:** It's not just about stolen money. Our insurance helps pay for:
    *   **Legal Fees & Fines:** To handle lawsuits and regulatory penalties.
    *   **Customer Notification:** The cost of informing your customers their data was compromised.
    *   **Business Recovery:** The costs to get your systems back up and running.
*   **Access to Experts:** When an incident happens, you're not alone. You get immediate access to a team of legal, PR, and technical experts to guide you through the crisis.
