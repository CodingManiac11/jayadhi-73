# Draft Content: Compliance Tracker Modules

### Module 1: CERT-In Incident Reporting

*   **The Rule:** The CERT-In guidelines state that specific types of cyber incidents must be reported to the government within 6 hours of being noticed.
*   **Why it Matters:** Reporting on time is a legal requirement. Failure to do so can result in significant fines and legal action. It also helps the government track threats and protect other businesses.
*   **Your Action:** If you experience an incident (like ransomware or a data leak), you must use the official CERT-In portal to submit a report. Our tool can help you identify if an event is reportable.

### Module 2: The IT Act, 2000 (Section 43A)

*   **The Rule:** If your business possesses or handles any sensitive personal data, you must implement and maintain reasonable security practices to protect it.
*   **Why it Matters:** This rule makes you responsible for protecting your customers' data. If you are negligent and a breach occurs, you are liable to pay damages to the people affected.
*   **Your Action:** Our platform helps you implement "reasonable security" by scanning for vulnerabilities, providing employee training, and ensuring data is backed up.

# Marketing Copy: Don't Let One Click Bankrupt Your Business

### You're an expert in your business. We're experts in protecting it.

Cyber attacks aren't just a "big company" problem anymore. A single ransomware attack or data breach can cost a small business everything. Cyber insurance is your financial safety net.

**What Cyber Insurance Does For You (The Benefits):**

*   **Peace of Mind:** Stop worrying about the "what ifs." Focus on your customers, knowing you're protected from the financial fallout of an attack.
*   **Covers the Real Costs:** It's not just about stolen money. Our insurance helps pay for:
    *   **Legal Fees & Fines:** To handle lawsuits and regulatory penalties.
    *   **Customer Notification:** The cost of informing your customers their data was compromised.
    *   **Business Recovery:** The costs to get your systems back up and running.
*   **Access to Experts:** When an incident happens, you're not alone. You get immediate access to a team of legal, PR, and technical experts to guide you through the crisis.

# Support & FAQ

### **Q: What does my "Security Score" mean?**
**A:** Your Security Score is a simple rating from 0-100 that shows how well-protected your business is. We calculate it based on your technical scans, employee training progress, and compliance status. The higher, the better!

### **Q: I received a phishing email. What should I do?**
**A:** Do not click any links or download any attachments. Use our "Report Phishing" button in your email client to automatically forward the suspicious email to our security team for analysis.

### **Q: How do I reset my password?**
**A:** You can reset your password by clicking the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page.

This commit introduces the finalized V1 pricing structure for the Sentinel platform, establishing three distinct tiers: Freemium, Essential, and Growth.

The model is based on competitive analysis and a user-maturity framework, designed to align value with customer growth stages rather than just feature-gating.

- **Freemium:** A permanent free tier to act as a lead-generation engine and build user trust. Limited to 1 user and basic alerts.
- **Essential:** The core offering for typical SMEs (2-20 employees), providing all necessary security and reporting features.
- **Growth:** A premium tier for scaling businesses and "Accidental IT Managers" who require unlimited users and priority support.

This structure serves as the foundation for the Go-To-Market strategy and all sales collateral.

Adds the initial Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy document. This document outlines the comprehensive plan for launching the product, acquiring initial users, and establishing market presence.

Key sections include:
- Target Audience Definition (including primary and secondary personas)
- Core Marketing & Messaging Pillars
- Channel Strategy (Digital, Partnerships, Content)
- Pilot Program Objectives & KPIs

This document will serve as the strategic guide for all launch-related activities and will be updated as we gather feedback from the pilot program.

Creates the first drafts of essential sales collateral required for the pilot program outreach and initial sales conversations.

- **One-Pager:** A concise, single-page PDF summarizing the product's value proposition, key features, and target audience. Designed for quick sharing.
- **Pitch Deck:** A 10-slide presentation (PowerPoint/Google Slides) that provides a more detailed narrative for sales calls. It covers the problem, solution, product demo, pricing, and call-to-action.

These assets are based on the finalized GTM strategy and pricing model and will be iterated upon based on feedback from pilot users.

Adds operational files to support the pilot user acquisition campaign.

- **Outreach Templates:** Includes standardized email and LinkedIn message templates for contacting potential pilot users. The messaging focuses on a collaborative "founding member" approach.
- **Tracking Spreadsheet:** A CSV template for tracking outreach status (Contacted, Replied, Onboarded) to ensure a systematic and organized campaign.

This provides the necessary tooling to execute the outreach portion of the GTM strategy effectively.
